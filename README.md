# EMIT Mechanical Intelligence Design (Open Source)
## Machine Learning on TPMS dataset

This repository contains an Excel dataset and a machine learning project inspired by the arXiv paper [Title of the Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640).
## Open Source Scope
EMIT needs reliability in 3D printing manufacturing and the opensource project is for reproduction, and reliability in engineering for its impacful applicaiton to find missing items like crashed airplanes in ocean, sunked sip, sunked containers or missing divers. We believe EMIT should be opensource technology to be improve collaboration between AI scienttist amd intelligent mechanical metaterial scientists work on EMIT mechanical intelligence.

## Files
- `TPMS_BNF_data.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `preprocess.py`: Script for data preprocessing.
- `train_model.py`: Script for training the machine learning model.
- `evaluate_model.py`: Script for evaluating the trained model.
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook documenting the entire workflow in one single file like instruction. 

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/danielsaatchi/emit.git
    cd your-repository
    ```
2. Set up a miniconda=4.8.3 or later version environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the scripts or open the Jupyter notebook to explore the project with images and reproduction.
